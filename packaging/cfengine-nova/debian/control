Description: CFEngine Nova : The next generation tool for data centre.
 CFEngine, or the configuration engine is an agent/software robot and a
 very high level language for building expert systems to administrate
 and configure large computer networks. CFEngine uses the idea of
 classes and a primitive form of intelligence to define and automate
 the configuration and maintenance of system state, for small to huge
 configurations. CFEngine is designed to be a part of a computer immune
 system.
