The source tarballs here are generated in each and every
buildslave. THIS IS NOT THE TARBALL TO BE RELEASED! This is only to make
sure that "make dist" works everywhere.

The release tarball is generated from the "bootstrap-*-community"
jenkins jobs, running only on one buildslave. It should be located under
the "output/tarballs" directory of that job.
